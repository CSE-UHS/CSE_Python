      "   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes, Objects and Methods are very powerful programming tools. They make programming easier. In fact, you are already familiar with the concept of classes and objects. A class is a \u201cclassification\u201d of an object. Think of a class as the \"blueprint\" of how to build a house. The blueprint is the class. The house is the object. Just as you can make several houses from one blueprint, you can create several objects from one class.  An object is called an \"instance\" of a class. When we create an object from a class it is called \"instantiation\". Objects have attributes, such as a person's name, height, and age. Objects also have methods (functions). Methods define what an object can do, like run, jump, or sit.</p>\n",

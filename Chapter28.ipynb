    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling the two LEDs located under the buttons of the EV3 brick must be one of the simplest things we can do in EV3 Python so... we saved it until close to the end! The official documentation is <a href=\"http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other.html#leds\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>. Note that the <b>Leds</b> class is a child of the <b>Led</b> class so you should look at the documentation for that too. All you really need to know as a beginner is how to set the color of each LED and how to make the LEDs blink. For other functions such as setting the brightness of each LED, see the official documentation."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this program's loop, the very important command <b>btn.process()</b> checks for any change in the state of the buttons. If it detects a change then it triggers the corresponding 'events'. For example, if it detects that the left button has just been pressed then it triggers a <b>'left button state change'</b> event and a <b>'button change'</b> event. It also assigns a value of True to the parameter state if the button is pressed and a value of False if the button is released. Event handlers respond to the events. For example, if the left button is pressed then the <b>'left button state change'</b> event will trigger the <b>on_left</b> event handler which will call the function <b>'left'</b> (the function does not have to have this name).\n",

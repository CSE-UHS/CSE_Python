    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier activity, you learned how to use nested for loops to conditionally change color values of individual pixels. You did this using code from the matplotlib and numpy libraries. You used statements like img[r][c] = [0, 255, 255] to change the pixels in part of an image. To cause the graduation cap to be cyan, for example, the statement img[r][c] = [0, 255, 255] was inside an <b>if</b> block. The <b>if</b> structure was inside a <b>for</b> loop, which was inside another <b>for</b> loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A software developer’s job usually includes learning how to use other people’s code. It is often much quicker to find and learn how to use code that someone else has created than it is to create the code on your own. We will use code from the PIL, the Python Imaging Library, to perform image manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that an API, or application programming interface, tells you how to use someone else’s code. PIL, like matplotlib, is an object-oriented library of code. Object-oriented code creates and manipulates objects, which are data structures defined in the code. PIL’s objects include images. The matplotlib library’s objects include figures and axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For object-oriented code, the API lists the attributes and methods for each class. Almost always, at least one of the methods instantiates the class. Instantiation means creating an object, also known as an instance, of the class. The instantiation methods that do this are sometimes called constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you are learning to manipulate images in this activity, a primary objective is to understand how to find, select, and use API documentation. These skills will enable you to learn how to use other people’s code.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RGBA file type includes a fourth byte called the alpha channel. The alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque an image is. Only some file types can store an alpha channel. <b>PNG files can store the alpha channel.

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buttons are used to navigate on the display screen. There are <b>up, right, down</b> and <b>left buttons</b> that help you navigate. The center button is called the <b>Enter</b> or <b>Select</b> button and will be used to select and run your programs as well as turn on the Brick. The <b>Back</b> button is kind of in a weird location but is a very important button. It can be pressed to get down to the <b>Shutdown</b> screen so that you can power down the Brick. Probably the most important use is that you can interrupt a running program by doing a long press of the back button.\n",

Put the SD Card in your EV3 and power it on by pushing the <b>Select</b> button. At first, you will see the MINDSTORMS boot splash and the red LEDs will be on. This is immediately followed by the ev3dev boot splash and the LEDs changing to orange. The LEDs indicate disk (SD card) activity. After about one minute, the screen will go blank. This happens on the first boot only. The first boot takes longer than subsequent boots. After another minute or two, you will see the brickman loading… screen. When the boot is complete, the LEDs will turn green. You’ll often want to turn off your EV3 while it isn't in use. Turn off the EV3 by pressing the back button from the main menu in brickman or pressing and holding the back button from any screen in brickman.

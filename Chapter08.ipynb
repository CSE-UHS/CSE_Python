      "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we learn about version control and collaboration solutions, we will explore and modify existing code that simulates a round-robin tournament among 15 players. The game is called the Iterative Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma (IPD), a fundamental problem in game theory. Game theory is an approach to studying the social sciences, using computation to understand and predict people\u2019s behavior. Game theory is used, for example, to understand and predict economic phenomena like stock market fluctuations and political phenomena like revolutions. Nations use game theorists to advise national leaders and negotiators in order to help them understand the group\u2019s dynamics and predict results for various actions they are considering taking.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game theorists use algorithms to describe people\u2019s decisions. Consider your decision to buy lunch each day. If the cafeteria director decides to raise the lunch price above a certain point, you will opt not to buy school lunch, right? At what price? Are there other factors? A game theorist could write an algorithm for the decision to buy school lunch in terms of price and other factors.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iterative Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma is a series of rounds of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma was one of the early algorithmic problems in game theory, first posed in 1950. In the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, you and a partner have committed a crime together, and you are caught without evidence. The police question you and your partner separately.</p>\n",

      "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Iterative Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, many rounds are played, one after another, with the same partner in crime. Betraying in one round will sometimes cause the partner to lose trust and be less likely to collude with you in future rounds. Once partners start betraying each other, round after round they end up turning each other in and doing poorly. Considered together, you and your partner\u2019s outcomes are better if you collude round after round. The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma lets social scientists study the conditions under which people will act either selfishly or in the best collective interests of the group.</p>\n",

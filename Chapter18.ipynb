As the (y) values go up, the computer coordinate position moved down the screen, just like lines of text rather than standard Cartesian graphics.\n",

It is possible to draw items at negative coordinates, but they will be drawn off-screen. This can be useful when part of a shape is off screen. The computer figures out what is off-screen and the programmer does not need to worry too much about it."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK! Let's try to use Python and the Tkinter library to draw our graphic that we designed above. Create a new file in your working directory and name it <b>TkinterDraw.py</b>. We start by importing the Tkinter module. It contains all classes, functions and other things needed to work with the Tk toolkit. In most cases, you can simply import everything from Tkinter into your module’s namespace. The (*) means to import everything from the library. Generally we don't do this because it can sometime slow down our program. Generally, you just import certain things that you need from the library.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To initialize Tkinter, we have to create a Tk root widget. This is an ordinary window, with a title bar and other decoration provided by your window manager. You should only create one root widget for each program, and it must be created before any other widgets. A lot of times, coders name this window 'root' but you don't have to. I named mine <b>my_window</b>. The line of code below shows how create the window.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of your new window will be called <b>Tk</b>. We can call a title attribute on our new window and title the window whatever we want. Below is how you do that.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This window and anything we put into the window will never show up until we call the <b>mainloop( ) function</b> on our window. This <b>Tkinter event loop</b> is the last line of code in our program. Drop down many lines of code to include the following. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will stay in the event loop until we close the window. The event loop doesn’t only handle events from the user (such as mouse clicks and key presses) or the windowing system (such as redraw events and window configuration messages), it also handle operations queued by Tkinter itself. Among these operations are geometry management (queued by the pack or grid methods) and display updates. This also means that the application window will not appear before you enter the main loop. <b>We will put all of the important parts of our program between the creation of the window (line 5) and entering the main loop.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't actually draw objects in our window. We will need to create a widget in the window called a <b>Canvas</b> and then we will be able to draw objects on it. You can name your Canvas object anything you would like. I named my Canvas object <b>drawing_pad</b> and created it by calling the <b>Canvas</b> class. There are several attibutes of the Canvas class that can be used. The first one is very important and is the name of your window in which you are going to insert your Canvas widget. The other attributes we used were height, width, relief and bg. Look these up in the documentation <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm#Tkinter.Canvas.config-method\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to see what they do to the Canvas object.<br><br>\n",

There are a couple of \"geometry managers\" that we can use called grid( ) and pack( ). We will be using the <b>grid( ) method</b>. Basically the grid( ) method can divide your window up into a table format starting at row=0 and column=0 and then you can insert different widgets in different parts of the window. We aren't too worried about that right now so in the line of code below since we didn't put anything into the grid( ) method our window will just contain one grid cell and the Canvas object will fill the entire window. <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/grid.htm\" target=\"_blank\">(Read Grid Documentation)</a><br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code below is the third function called round( ), which I probably shouldn't have used since there is already a round function built into Python for rounding numbers. Oh well...too late! Again try to go through the code line by line and decode what this third function is doing. This function brings everything together by calling the other two functions."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame( ) function will take two arguments, color and wide, which will specify the color and width of the border that will be put around each picture in the directory. It will look like <b>frame(wide, color, directory=None)</b> The frame is specified by a color tuple (r,g,b) and has a certain pixel thickness wide. To call the function you might enter into the iSession window the following:<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would put a 5 pixel wide, green frame around each Star Wars image.

For those of you that like a challenge, below is my alteration where I decided to print each Star Wars character's name 3/4 of the way down the picture and horizontally centered inside a \"TIE fighter\" style frame. When you are happy with your final algorithm demonstrate it for your instructor and submit it online.<br><br>\n",

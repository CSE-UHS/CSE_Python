Rather than the zero (y) coordinate at the bottom of the graph like in Cartesian graphics, the zero (y) coordinate is at the top of the screen with the computer. As the (y) values go up, the computer coordinate position moved down the screen, just like lines of text rather than standard Cartesian graphics.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, note the screen covers the lower right quadrant, whereas the Cartesian coordinate system usually focuses on the upper right quadrant. It is possible to draw items at negative coordinates, but they will be drawn off-screen. This can be useful when part of a shape is off screen. The computer figures out what is off-screen and the programmer does not need to worry too much about it."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK! Let's try to use Python and the Tkinter library to draw our graphic that we designed above. Create a new file in your working directory and name it <b>TkinterDraw.py</b>. We start by importing the Tkinter module. It contains all classes, functions and other things needed to work with the Tk toolkit. In most cases, you can simply import everything from Tkinter into your module’s namespace. The (*) means to import everything from the library. Generally we don't do this because it can sometime slow down our program. Generally, you just import certain things that you need from the library.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To initialize Tkinter, we have to create a Tk root widget. This is an ordinary window, with a title bar and other decoration provided by your window manager. You should only create one root widget for each program, and it must be created before any other widgets. A lot of times, coders name this window 'root' but you don't have to. I named mine <b>my_window</b>. The line of code below shows how create the window.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of your new window will be called <b>Tk</b>. We can call a title attribute on our new window and title the window whatever we want. Below is how you do that.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This window and anything we put into the window will never show up until we call the <b>mainloop( ) function</b> on our window. This <b>Tkinter event loop</b> is the last line of code in our program. Drop down many lines of code to include the following. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will stay in the event loop until we close the window. The event loop doesn’t only handle events from the user (such as mouse clicks and key presses) or the windowing system (such as redraw events and window configuration messages), it also handle operations queued by Tkinter itself. Among these operations are geometry management (queued by the pack or grid methods) and display updates. This also means that the application window will not appear before you enter the main loop. <b>We will put all of the important parts of our program between the creation of the window (line 5) and entering the main loop. (line 57)</b> <font color=\"red\"><b> At this time, run your program to make sure that your created window opens up. You can can grab a corner and resize it.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't actually draw objects in our window. We will need to create a widget in the window called a <b>Canvas</b> and then we will be able to draw objects on it. You can name your Canvas object anything you would like. I named my Canvas object <b>drawing_pad</b> and created it by calling the <b>Canvas</b> class. There are several attibutes of the Canvas class that can be used. The first one is very important and is the name of your window in which you are going to insert your Canvas widget. The other attributes we used were height, width, relief and bg. Look these up in the documentation <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm#Tkinter.Canvas.config-method\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to see what they do to the Canvas object.<br><br>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I need to tell the computer where in my window should I place the canvas. There are a couple of \"geometry managers\" that we can use called grid( ) and pack( ). We will be using the <b>grid( ) method</b>. Basically the grid( ) method can divide your window up into a table format starting at row=0 and column=0 and then you can insert different widgets in different parts of the window. We aren't too worried about that right now so in the line of code below since we didn't put anything into the grid( ) method our window will just contain one grid cell and the Canvas object will fill the entire window. <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/grid.htm\" target=\"_blank\">(Read Grid Documentation)</a><br><br>\n",

A circle again uses the <b>create_oval method</b>. Since we are going to create several circle objects we will first create a list variable to hold all of them. Line 20 shows that I created an empty list variable called <b>circles</b>. Next we made our <b>for</b> loop that uses the <b>range</b> that hopefully you figured out up in question <b>(d)</b>. In this <b>for</b> loop we will create circles and append each circle to the list. We will use the radius in the <b>for</b> loop to change the upper left and lower right coordinates of the bounding boxes that circumscribe each concentric circle.  We also used an <b>outline</b> parameter that colors the circle. Analyze this code and try to really have a good understanding. Ask your instuctor for help if you are not sure.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we would like to go back and change one of the attributes of an object that we already made? To do this we will use the <b>itemconfig method</b>. Let's say for example that we want to change the third concentric circle to black. This is fairly easy. The first parameter of the method is the object id variable.

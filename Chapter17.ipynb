Throughout this chapter we will examine in depth each and every line of code...so yes...this is definitely a note taking chapter. In this chapter you will be asked <b>35</b> questions (<font color=\"red\"><b>which you will find in bold red</b></font>) and you will record your answers in your notebook. You will probably find this assignment a lot more satisfying if you can find a partner to work with together on these questions. If neither of you understand a question do not hesitate to ask another colleague or your instructor. Don't move on without understanding a question.

    "So here's the crazy news! We're not really going to do much with our newly created rounded_mask object. In fact the RGB colors were completely and totally irrelevant. The Alpha channel was the only thing we were interested in. Basically we made an object the same size as the image we will be importing that will be tranparent in the rounded corners.

    "20.) At what coordinates on the \"result\" image are we pasting the top-left corner of the original_image?<br>\n",
    "<font size=\"+1\" color=\"white\">(0,0) So we are laying the original_image over our transparent result image of the same size.</font><br>\n",
    "</b></font> \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last and most important parameter of the paste() method is mask. The mask parameter tells the computer which pixels to make opaque and which ones to make transparent in the image that we are pasting on to the first image. If you remember the rounded_mask image that we made but never really used was transparent in the corners (alpha=0) and opaque everywhere else (alpha=255). The colors of the rounded_mask image as we said earlier were completely irrelevant. The only reason we created that \"mask\" or \"template\" or \"cookie-cutter\" shape was to enter it as the mask argument in the paste() method. The only thing we cared about when creating the rounded_mask object was making pixels opaque (alpha=255) or transparent (alpha=0). So...when we tell the computer <b>\"mask = rounded_mask\"</b> we are saying, apply the same masking technique to the original_image as we created in the rounded_mask object. And by the way...we didn't have to name the object \"rounded_mask\". We could have called it by any variable name such as \"my_shape_template\" and still used it as the mask parameter in the paste( ) method. <font color=\"blue\"><b>[Now re-read this paragraph 5 more times or at least until you grasp this concept!]</b></font> <br><br>\n",

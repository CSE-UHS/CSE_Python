    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All GUIs are based on events and event handlers. Tkinter provides four ways to connect an event to an event handler. Three of them are:<br>\n",
    "•\tthe variable argument of a widget<br>\n",
    "•\tthe command argument of a widget<br>\n",
    "•\tthe bind() method of a widget<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>variable argument</b> doesn't let you write your own event handler; it just changes the value of the variable when the user uses the widget. The <b>command argument</b> lets you write your own event handler but only for the widget's built-in kind of event. The <b>bind( )</b> method, however, lets you write your own event handler and attach it to any event that exists. The events include mouse, keyboard, and timer events. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-Click to download and then analyze the GUI called <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90219577/Hermon/CSE_Website/notebooks/20/canvas_circle_art.py\">color_circle_art.py</a>. An artist is working on a series of acrylic paintings on large canvases. To plan each painting, she wants to paint circles on screens of different colors and experiment with their size, color, position, and overlap. In the code you will see the keyword <b>global</b>. Variables either have a <b>global</b> or a <b>local scope</b>. The scope of a variable identifies which part of a program can use the variable name to refer to the variable's value. For example, the scope of the variable <b>new_shape</b> is local to the <b>up</b> function and would be garbage collected shortly after <b>up( )</b> returned. The canvas object might (in fact does) continue to know about the new_shape, but the new_shape variable that is bound to the object will get garbage collected. That is why new_shape has to be put into the list shapes. The variables <b>startx</b> and <b>starty</b> are defined as <b>global</b> because they needed to be used everywhere including outide of that particular function. Modify the GUI so that it performs as can be seen in one of the following videos:<br><br>\n",
    "1.) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_K8OwEqgMg0\" target=\"_blank\">video</a><br>\n",

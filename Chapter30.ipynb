    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All GUIs are based on events and event handlers. Tkinter provides four ways to connect an event to an event handler. Three of them are:<br><br>\n",
    "<b>•\tthe variable argument of a widget<br>\n",
    "•\tthe command argument of a widget<br>\n",
    "•\tthe bind( ) method of a widget</b><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>variable argument</b> doesn't let you write your own event handler; it just changes the value of the variable when the user uses the widget. The <b>command argument</b> lets you write your own event handler but only for the widget's built-in kind of event. The <b>bind( )</b> method, however, lets you write your own event handler and attach it to any event that exists like if the user hits the up-arrow key for example. The events include mouse, keyboard, and timer events. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the \"canvas circle art\" GUI. An artist is working on a series of acrylic paintings on large canvases. To plan each painting, she wants to paint circles on screens of different colors and experiment with their size, color, position, and overlap. In the code you will see the keyword <b>global</b>. Variables either have a <b>global</b> or a <b>local scope</b>. The scope of a variable identifies which part of a program can use the variable name to refer to the variable's value. For example, the scope of the variable <b>new_shape</b> is local to the <b>up</b> function and would be garbage collected shortly after <b>up( )</b> returned. The canvas object might (in fact does) continue to know about the new_shape, but the new_shape variable that is bound to the object will get garbage collected. That is why new_shape has to be put into the list shapes. The variables <b>startx</b> and <b>starty</b> are defined as <b>global</b> because they needed to be used everywhere including outside of that particular function.<br> <br>\n",

In your radio buttons let 1 be for a circle and 2 be for a rectangle. In your <b>up( )</b> function you will need to use a <b>.get( )</b> and an <b>if</b> statement to check the value of <b>which_shape</b> to see whether to draw a circle or a rectangle.

Now using Pythagorean's Theorem determine the distance (d) between where the Double Click event occurred and where the center of the circle is located. Finally, make an <b>if</b> statement to see if (d) is less than (r). If it is that means you are within that shape and you should use <b>.itemconfig</b> to change the <b>fill</b> and <b>outline</b> of the shape.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tkinter usually accomplishes animation using recursion. <b>Recursion</b> is when a function calls itself. Recursion is one of the four building blocks of algorithms:<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you discovered in Scratch, animation is created by moving a graphic element a small distance after each small time interval. In Tkinter, this is accomplished with the <b>after(msec, handler) method</b> of a Tkinter widget. The argument <b>msec</b> is an integer number of milliseconds, and the argument handler is the function name of the event handler. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>after( ) method</b> creates a single timer. When the timer completes its time, it calls the handler only once. To call the handler over and over, we call the <b>after( ) method</b> again at the end of the handler, so the handler indirectly calls itself. When something references itself, surprising beauty and elegance can result.<br><br>\n",

We didn't mention these earlier because they are not part of the standard Educational Kit and therefore cannot be used in various competitions. Usually robots need to have self-automation programs for various competitions. However, since it is fun to remotely control robots we will learn how to do that here."

You also want to use a Color Sensor so you can turn around if you ever get to the white edge of the mat. You obviously do not want to drive off the mat by yourself.

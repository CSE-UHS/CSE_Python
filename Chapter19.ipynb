    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human-computer interaction (HCI) depends on the user knowing how to use the interface. A good interface is intuitive or easy to learn. Mice and touchscreens are now so common that users expect certain behavior tied to these devices in a graphical user interface (GUI). How do programs usually respond to user input? You are familiar with what programmers have settled on as standard interfaces such as scroll bars or a dropdown menu. Such tools are often packaged in an API as widgets. How do programmers make the interface behave the way a user expects it to? How do software developers design a solution to a problem so that it can be reused for other, similar problems?"

These solutions are called design patterns. A design pattern guides software development, making it more likely that programmers will make rapid progress and avoid major roadblocks. You have seen that an object-oriented software solution is communicated by showing relationships among classes. Design patterns are even more abstract. \n",

A video card is the hardware component of a computer which accepts data and instructions from the computer's processor and renders an image on the computer's monitor(s). We will build this program step by step together using the MVC pattern and then you will modify it in the activity at the end of this chapter.

    "<h2><b>MODEL</b></h2><br> The first code we will write we will classify at the <b>model section</b> of our MVC pattern although it doesn't really contain that much data. The first thing we are going to do is initialize a variable called <b>radius</b> and set it to 100 pixels. We will be using a Tkinter slider widget to change the value of <b>radius</b> during the program and it's not possible to hand over a regular Python variable to a Tkinter widget. The only kinds of variables for which this works are variables that are subclassed from a class called Variable, defined in the Tkinter library. They are declared like this:<br><br>\n",
    "<b>x = StringVar() # Holds a string; default value \"\"<br>\n",
    "x = IntVar() # Holds an integer; default value 0<br>\n",
    "x = DoubleVar() # Holds a float; default value 0.0<br>\n",
    "x = BooleanVar() # Holds a boolean, returns 0 for False and 1 for True</b><br><br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To read the current value of such a variable, call the method <b>get( )</b>. The value of such a variable can be changed with the <b>set( )</b> method. Since we want our radius variable to be an integer we will use the Tkinter variable type, <b>IntVar( )</b>. We will then use the <b>set( )</b> method to initialize the radius at 100 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also will set values for x and y which will be the center of the circle. We are setting them to 175 and 175 because later we will be making a drawing canvas like we did in the last chapter and the size of that canvas will be 350 x 350. Therefore the circle will be centered in the canvas.\n",

    "<h2><b>VIEW</b></h2><br> We will now drop down again just above the mainloop section to create the <b>view section</b> of our MVC pattern. We could make an argument that the slider, the directions and the circle should all be created in the <b>VIEW</b> section. However, we are going to consider the slider and the directions to be in the <b>CONTROLLER</b> section and we are only going to worry about the circle being in the <b>VIEW</b> section.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a circle you first have to create a Canvas widget on which to draw shapes. I created a Canvas object on line 43, which I called, <b>the_view</b>. The Canvas object is placed into the root window, given a size of 350 x 350 and a white background color. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On line 44 we use the <b>grid( )</b> method to place the canvas object into the correct section of the window. In the last chapter we never entered any arguments into the grid( ) method which meant the canvas would just fill the entire window. This time, however, we did use arguments. We are able to divide our window up by creating a table or grid of cells/containers for various widgets. We label rows starting with row=0 and columns starting with column=0. If you look at the GUI that we are trying to create, there are directions in the upper left, a slider in the lower left and the circle in a cell that covers both rows. Therefore, we want the Canvas to be in the second column (column=1) and span the first two rows. Therefore we set <b>column=1, row=0</b> and use <b>rowspan=2</b>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we need to draw the circle on the Canvas. First we need to <b>get( )</b> the radius variable on line 47. Next we create the circle using the <b>create_oval</b> method. For arguments of this method we have the upper left and lower right coordinates of the circle's bounding box as well as a black outline and a cyan fill color. I called my circle object, <b>circle_item</b>.\n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lines 22-30 we made a simple function called <b>radius_changed</b> that requires a variable called <b>new_radius</b> to be entered when the function is called. In the function we do another <b>get( )</b>method to determine the current radius of the circle. Then on the Canvas we used the <b>coords( )</b> method to update the bounding box coordinates of the <b>circle_item</b>. This is a pretty simple function and it will be called every time the slider is dragged to a different number.\n",

Read the official documentation about sliders <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/scale.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. We entered 6 arguments into our Scale( ) method. The first one, AS ALWAYS, is the window. The next two are the <b>from_</b> and <b>to</b> paramters which define the minimum and maximum values that can be assigned to our <b>radius</b> variable. Notice \"from\" is a reserved word in Python so it needs an underscore after it. The next argument is <b>variable</b>. Our variable is <b>radius</b>. Each time the slider is moved to a different value that value will be stored in <b>radius</b>. The <b>label</b> parameter is fairly obvious. It labels the slider with some text. Finally, the <b>command</b> parameter is set equal to our <b>radius_changed</b> function. This means every time the slider is moved it will continually call the function. The function then changes the radius of the circle.<br><br>\n",

That means it can respond more quickly than the Large Motor. The Medium Motor can be programmed to turn on or off, control its power level, or to run for a specified amount of time or rotations. It runs at 240-250 rpm, with a running torque of 8 Ncm and a stall torque of 12 Ncm. So the Medium Motor is faster but weaker than the Large Motor."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before programming with robots we haven't had a real important reason to learn about the <b>time module</b> in python because it wasn't important to pause our program for a while. In robot programming, however, time is very important. For example at the IT Olympics competition during the robot battles, your program needs a 3 second delay before moving. The <b>sleep( )</b> function will pause your program for a specified amount of time in seconds. To be able to use the <b>sleep( )</b> function, we will import it from the time module at the top of our program. You then can call the <b>sleep( )</b> function at any time during your program. You will use this a lot in programming robots so you probably will always want to include the <b>import sleep</b> statement as your third line in your program. The statement below will pause your program for 100 milliseconds.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since motors are subject to the laws of physics, the actual speed may not correspond to the programmed speed. For example, from the code above you might expect the wheel to turn backwards 3.0s * 750&ordm;/s = 2250&ordm;. Since one rotation equals 360&ordm;, dividing 2250&ordm;/360&ordm; gives us 6.25 rotations of the wheel. If we knew the diameter of the wheel we could then calculate how far the robot would travel linearly. In reality it will not travel that far because it takes a while to reach its programmed speed and therefore for a short period at the beginning of the motion the motor turns less fast than programmed. Also, be aware that most EV3 large motors are not quite capable of reaching a speed of 1000 degrees per second so for values of <b>speed_sp</b> above 900 you might get an actual speed that is a few percent less than what you programmed. <b><u>Because of this if you are entering a competition it would probably be a good idea to collect data ahead of time about how far your robot actually travels for different times at a given speed.</u></b>"

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you've probably learned by now when something goes wrong with your program, ugly error messages are thrown up in the Session window. We would rather our user not see this happen. To solve this problem we need exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions are used to handle abnormal conditions that can occur during the execution of code. Exceptions are often used with file and network operations. This allows code to gracefully handle running out of disk space, network errors, or permission errors."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several terms and phrases used while working with exceptions. Here are the most common:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><i><b>Exception</b></i>: This term could mean one of two things. First, the condition that results in abnormal program flow. Or it could be used to refer to an object that represents the data condition. Each exception has an object that holds information about it.\n",
    "<li><i><b>Exception handling</b></i>: The process of handling an exception to normal program flow.\n",
    "<li><i><b>Catch block or exception block</b></i>: Code that handles an abnormal condition is said to “catch” the exception.\n",
    "<li><i><b>Throw or raise</b></i>: When an abnormal condition to the program flow has been detected, an instance of an exception object is created. It is then “thrown” or “raised” to code that will catch it.\n",
    "<li><i><b>Unhandled exception or Uncaught exception</b></i>: An exception that is thrown, but never caught. This usually results in an error and the program ending or crashing.\n",
    "<li><i><b>Try block</b></i>: A set of code that might have an exception thrown in it.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most programming languages use the terms “throw” and “catch.” Unfortunately Python doesn't. Python uses “raise” and “exception.” We introduce the throw/catch vocabulary here because they are the most prevalent terms in the industry."

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>First import print_function, matplotlib and numpy.</li>\n",
    "<li>Start with a done=False and then a while not done loop.</li>\n",

    "<li>If they enter Q set done = True to get out of the loop.</li>\n",
    "<li>Once out of the loop print something like \"Goodbye, thanks for using my excel!\". Run this to make sure it works.</li>\n",
    "<li>Now back at the top of the while loop set a variable called plotnum_entered = False.</li>\n",
    "<li>Now start a while not plotnum_entered loop.</li>\n",
    "<li>In this loop put a Try: Except:</li>\n",
    "<li>In the Try Block set a variable called plot_num to the answer of an integer raw_input question of \"How many data sets are you plotting?\"</li>\n",
    "<li>Check to see if plot_num is equal to 1 or 2. If it is set plotnum_entered to True.</li>\n",
    "<li>In the Except Block print \"Please enter a 1 or a 2.\" If someone tried to enter a letter rather than a number that would throw up an error. The Except block will catch that for us.</li>\n",
    "<li>Now set a variable called found_file = False.</li>\n",
    "<li>Now start a while not found_file loop.</li>\n",
    "<li>In this loop put a Try: Except:</li>\n",
    "<li>In the Try Block set a variable called csvfile to the answer of a raw_input question, \"What is the name of your csv file?\"</li>\n",
    "<li>Use an if statement to see if plotnum is equal to 1. If it is load the txt file, calculate the slope and y-intercept and plot the graph and best fit line.</li>\n",
    "<li>Then use an elif statement to see if plotnum is equal to 2. If it is load the txt file, calculate slopes and y-intercepts and plot the graphs and best fit lines.</li>\n",
    "<li>Outside of the if-else set found_file equal to True.</li>\n",
    "<li>Write the Except block like (except Exception as e:) and then print(e). This will just let Python write the error for us which of course would be something like \"file could not be found.\" Make sure you test that later by entering an incorrect file name.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ask raw_input statments for title, x label, y label, background color and what to name the output file.</li>\n",
    "<li>Plot the xlabel, ylabel, title and legend.</li>\n",
    "<li>Set the location of the legend as best.</li>\n",
    "<li>Set the background color of the legend as white.</li>\n",
    "<li>Plot a black axvline and axhline at 0.</li>\n",
    "<li>Set up another Try: Except:</li>\n",
    "<li>In the Try: block set the background color of the graph to whatever the user entered.</li>\n",
    "<li>In the Except: block set the background color of the graph to white. This is in case the user did not enter a correct hexidecimal value.</li>\n",
    "<li>Save the output file.</li>\n",

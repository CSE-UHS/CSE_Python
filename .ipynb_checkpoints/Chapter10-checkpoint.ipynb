    "   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes, Objects and Methods are very powerful programming tools. They make programming easier. In fact, you are already familiar with the concept of classes and objects. A class is a “classification” of an object. Think of a class as the \"blueprint\" of how to build a house. The blueprint is the class. The house is the object. Just as you can make several houses from one blueprint, you can create several objects from one class.  An object is called an \"instance\" of a class. When we create an object from a class it is called \"instantiation\". Objects have attributes, such as a person's name, height, and age. Objects also have methods (functions). Methods define what an object can do, like run, jump, or sit.</p>\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another powerful feature of using classes and objects is the ability to make use of inheritance. It is possible to create a class and inherit all of the attributes and methods of a parent class. For example perhaps we decide that some of the characters in our game will be called droids and they will have all of the attributes of the Character class except they need to beep. We can create a new Droid class and inherit all the attributes and methods from the Character class. THAT'S AWESOME!"

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier activity, you learned how to use nested for loops to conditionally change color values of individual pixels. You did this using code from the matplotlib and numpy libraries. You used statements like img[r][c] = [0, 255, 255] to change the pixels in part of an image. To cause the graduation cap to be cyan, for example, the statement img[r][c] = [0, 255, 255] was inside an if block. The if structure was inside a for loop, which was inside another for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A software developer’s job usually includes learning how to use other people’s code. It is often much quicker to find and learn how to use code that someone else has created than it is to create the code on your own. We will use code from the PIL, the Python Imaging Library, to perform image manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that an API, or application programming interface, tells you how to use someone else’s code. PIL, like matplotlib, is an object-oriented library of code. Object-oriented code creates and manipulates objects, which are data structures defined in the code. PIL’s objects include images. The matplotlib library’s objects include figures and axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For object-oriented code, the API lists the attributes and methods for each class. Almost always, at least one of the methods instantiates the class. Instantiation means creating an object, also known as an instance, of the class. The instantiation methods that do this are sometimes called constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you are learning to manipulate images in this activity, a primary objective is to understand how to find, select, and use API documentation. These skills will enable you to learn how to use other people’s code.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ways to send secret information in photographs using the lowest-place-value bits in each color byte. Concealing information in an image is called <b><u>steganography</u></b>, which is what this section should be entitled. (I just called it \"The Illuminati\" to try to get you to read it!) The 1s place and 2s place of each RGB pixel intensity could be changed to encode the numbers 0 to 63, more than enough for the alphabet. Let's see if you can understand how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say a single pixel in your image is colored white. The RGB array for this is [255, 255, 255]. The number 255 is a decimal number. We can convert it to a binary number which would use 8 bits or 1 byte of data. The array would now look like [11111111, 11111111, 11111111]. The ones and the twos place are what we call the <b>least significant bits</b>. We can change these least sigbits and not even come close to changing the color to the human eye.<br><br>\n",
    "<center> \n",
    "11111100 =  252<br>\n",
    "11111101 =  253<br>\n",
    "11111110 =  254<br>\n",
    "11111111 =  255<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have 2 <b>least significant bits</b> in each byte and 3 bytes/pixel we could use 6 bits/pixel to store information and no human would be able to notice a difference in the image. A string of 6 bits would allow us to encode 0 to 63. Since there are only 26 letters of the alphabet technically we would only need 5 bits to encode secret messages in pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at an example: Suppose we have a magneta pixel:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>RGB = (255, 0, 255) = (11111111, 00000000, 11111111) binary</center><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply changed the last two bits of each byte to the following:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>(111111<b>01</b>, 000000<b>10</b>, 111111<b>01</b>)</center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "we could stay very near the same color value of magenta but encode for the letter <b>(y)</b>. HOW, you ask? Well, first we set A-Z to equal 1-26. Next, we always take the last two bits of the binary pixel colors and string them together. So for our modified magenta pixel above that would be:<br><br>\n",
    "<center>011001</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This binary number 011001 converts to decimal 25 which would correlate to the 25th letter of the alphabet <b>(y)</b>! Even with a small 100 x 100 pixel image, you could send a 10,000 character hidden message. Crazy awesome, right? Below I have created a steganography program that will let you encode messages into an image file or decode messages from images that have already been encoded. Also below is an image which I have already encoded with a secret message. Use the program to determine the message. Once you have decoded it, feel free to encode with a new message and e-mail to a friend. They of course will not be able to determine the message unless they have this same decoding program.

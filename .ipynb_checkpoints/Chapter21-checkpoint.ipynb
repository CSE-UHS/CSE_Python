If you are being provided robots with the Python Environment already installed you can skip steps 1-2 although you should still read them.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to get the microSD card out of the EV3 brick so you can fold over a strip of electrical tape on the edge of it to use as a handle. Put the SD Card in your EV3 and power it on. At first, you will see the MINDSTORMS boot splash and the red LEDs will be on. This is immediately followed by the ev3dev boot splash and the LEDs changing to orange. The LEDs indicate disk (SD card) activity. After about one minute, the screen will go blank. This happens on the first boot only. The first boot takes longer than subsequent boots. After another minute or two, you will see the brickman loading… screen. When the boot is complete, the LEDs will turn green. You’ll often want to turn off your EV3 while it isn't in use. Turn off the EV3 by pressing the back button from the main menu in brickman or pressing and holding the back button from any screen in brickman. This will open a dialog where you can select Power Off to turn off the EV3."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently any USB Wi-Fi dongle which supports Linux will work but the one above is very tiny and works automatically just by plugging it in. Once you have plugged in a dongle, you can use Brickman’s \"Wireless and Networks > Wi-Fi\" menu to connect to a network. Make sure you check the \"Powered\" box so that it starts searching for Wi-Fi networks, and then choose the one you want from the list that appears. Type the password in, and you’re good to go. The EV3 brick should remember this in the future."

Any FTP client will work and I usually prefer a program for Mac called Fetch but FileZilla is a free download and works with any computers so we will use it here. The EV3 brick acts as a server so we will be able to connect to it. Open FileZilla and go to \"File\" > \"Site manager\". It should look something like this:\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ultrasonic Sensor can measure the distance to an object in front of it. It does this by sending out high-frequency sound waves and measuring how long it takes the sound to reflect back to the sensor. The sound frequency is too high for your to hear.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance to an object can be measured in either inches or centimeters. This allows you to program your robot to stop a certain distance from a wall or to find another robot to attack! \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using centimeter units, the detectable distance is between 3 and 250 centimeters (with an accuracy of a +/- 1 centimeter). When using inch units, the measurable distance is between 1 and 99 inches (with an accuracy of +/- 0.394 inches). A value of 255 cm or 100 in. means the sensor is not able to detect any object in front of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steady light around the sensor eyes tells you that the sensor is in <b>Measure Mode</b>. A blinking light tells you that it is in <b>Presence Mode</b>. In <b>Presence Mode</b>, this sensor can detect another Ultrasonic Sensor operating nearby. When listening for presence, the sensor detects sound signals but does not send them."

You can also put the value in inches by using the mode <b>'US-DIST-IN'</b>. If you have run the above program you are probably really confused. This is because there is an annoying problem with the EV3 robot when it comes to the Ultrasonic Sensor. <b><u>The returned values are actually decimal numbers without the decimal point</u>.</b> So if you heard 76 it's not actually 76 cm but 7.6 cm. It might be easier to think of the output as being in millimeters. Likewise if in inches and you hear 121, this is actually 12.1 inches. You can think of the returned value as being in tenths of inches. This is really deceiving and I pity the poor student who comes and asks me about it because they skipped over this paragraph."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EV3 has a 178 x 128 pixels monochrome (black and white) LCD. The coordinates of the top-left pixel are (0, 0) and the coordinates of the bottom-right pixel are (177, 127).\n",

    "To interact with the LCD you will mainly be using a powerful graphics library called Pillow which is part of standard Python rather than something unique to EV3 Python. Note that Pillow evolved out of the Python Image Library (PIL). There is some documentation on the EV3 Python bindings page but you will find much more detailed documentation in the official Pillow documentation HERE, especially the documentation on the ImageDraw module. The ImageDraw module provides the following methods:"

It also assigns a value of True to the parameter state if the button is pressed and a value of False if the button is released. Event handlers respond to the events.

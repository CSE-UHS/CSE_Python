The image below shows an early spreadsheet program run on an Apple ][ computer that was popular in the '80s. When positioning text on the screen, programmers started at the top calling it line 1. The screen continued down for 24 lines and across for 40 characters.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with plain text, it was possible to make rudimentary graphics by just using characters on the keyboard. See this cat shown below and look carefully at how it is drawn. When making this art, characters were still positioned starting with line 1 at the top. Many of you have used ASCII art in your Camel and Toin Coss Programs. Search the web for “ASCII art” and many more examples can be found. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The (x) coordinates work the same as the Cartesian coordinates system. But the  (y) coordinates are reversed. Rather than the zero (y) coordinate at the bottom of the graph like in Cartesian graphics, the zero (y) coordinate is at the top of the screen with the computer. As the (y) values go up, the computer coordinate position moved down the screen, just like lines of text rather than standard Cartesian graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, note the screen covers the lower right quadrant, whereas the Cartesian coordinate system usually focuses on the upper right quadrant. It is possible to draw items at negative coordinates, but they will be drawn off-screen. This can be useful when part of a shape is off screen. The computer figures out what is off-screen and the programmer does not need to worry too much about it."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The last and most important parameter of the paste() method is mask. The mask parameter tells the computer which pixels to make opaque and which ones to make transparent in the image that we are pasting on to the first image. If you remember the rounded_mask image that we made but never really used was transparent in the corners (alpha=0) and opaque everywhere else (alpha=255). The colors of the rounded_mask image as we said earlier were completely irrelevant. We created that \"mask\" or \"template\" or \"cookie-cutter\" shape to enter as the mask argument in the paste() method. The only thing we cared about when creating the rounded_mask object was making pixels opaque (alpha=255) or transparent (alpha=0). So...when we tell the computer \"mask = rounded_mask\" we are saying, apply the same masking technique to the original_image as we created in the rounded_mask object. And by the way...we didn't have to call the object \"rounded_mask\". We could have called it by any variable name such as \"my_shape_template\" and still used it as the mask parameter in the paste( ) method. <font color=\"blue\">[Now re-read this paragraph 5 more times or at least until you grasp this concept!]</font></b> <br><br>\n",

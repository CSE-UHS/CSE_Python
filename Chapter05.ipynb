Second, it is not possible to change the tuple once created. The term we use for that is immutable. Therefore lists are <b>mutable</b> and tuples are <b>immutable</b>. So why would we want to use a tuple if it is immutable? First, the computer can run faster if it knows the value won't change. Second, some lists we don't want to change, such as a list of RGB colors for red. The color red doesn't change, therefore an immutable tuple is a better choice. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are the steps to complete this program. For this assignment you basically just need to let the user move around from room to room but feel free to modify and add to your adventure over the course of the year. <b>Make sure you fully comment your code.</b><br><br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Create an empty array called <b>room_list</b>. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Create a variable called <b>room</b>. Set it equal to an array with five elements. For the first element, create a string with a description of your first room. The last four elements will be the number of the next room if the user goes north, east, south, or west in that order. Look at your sketch to see what numbers to use. Use None if no room hooks up in that direction. (Do not put None in quotes. It is a special value that represents no value.) </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Append this room to the <b>room list</b>.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Repeat the prior two steps for each room you want to create. Just re-use the room variable. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Create a variable called <b>current_room</b>. Set it to zero. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Print the <b>room_list</b> variable. Run the program. You should see a really long list of every room in your adventure.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Adjust your print statement to only print the first room (element zero) in the list. Run the program and confirm you get output similar to:<br><br>\n",
    "<center><b>['You are in a room. There is a passage to the north.', 1, None, None, None]</b></center></li><br>\n",
    "<li>Using <b>current_room</b> and <b>room_list</b>, print the current room the user is in. Since your first room is zero, the output should be the same as before. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Change the print statement so that you only print the description of the room, and not the rooms that hook up to it. Remember, if you are printing a list in a list the index goes after the first index. Don't do this: <b>room_list[current_room[0]]</b>, do this: <b>room_list[current_room][0]</b></li><br>\n",
    "<li>Create a variable called <b>done</b> and set it to <b>False</b>. Then move the printing of the room description inside a while loop that repeats until <b>done</b> is set to <b>True</b>.</li><br> \n",
    "<li>Before printing the description, add code to print a blank line. This will make it visually separate each turn when playing the game.</li><br> \n",
    "<li>After printing the room description, add a line of code that asks the user what direction they wish to go. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add an <b>if</b> statement to see if the user wants to go north. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>If the user wants to go north, create a variable called <b>next_room</b> and set it equal to <b>room_list[current_room][1]</b>, which should be the number for what room is to the north. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add another <b>if</b> statement to see if the next room is equal to <b>None</b>. If it is, print “You can't go that way.” Otherwise set <b>current_room</b> equal to <b>next_room</b>. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Test your program. Can you go north to a new room? </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add <b>elif</b> statements to handle east, south, and west. Add an else statement to let the user know the program doesn't understand what was typed. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add several rooms, at least five. It may be necessary to draw out the rooms and room numbers to keep everything straight. Test out the game. You can use \\n or triple quotes if you have a multi-line room description. </li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add a quit command. Make sure that the program works for upper and lower case directions. Have the program work if the user types in “north” or “n”. </li><br>\n",

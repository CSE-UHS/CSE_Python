    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game is flexible. For example, you could create a Star Wars themed versions of this game where you need to ride a wampa across Hoth.

    "<li>Create a boolean variable called done and set to False.</li><br>\n",

    "<li>Before your main program loop, create variables for miles traveled, thirst, camel tiredness. Set these to zero.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Create a variable for the distance the natives have traveled and set it to -20. (Twenty miles back.)</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Create and set an initial number of drinks in the canteen.</li><br>\n",
    "<li>Add an elif in your main program loop and see if the user is asking for status. If so, print out something like this:<br><br>\n",

    "Drinks in canteen:  3<br>\n",
    "The natives are 10 miles behind you.<br><br>\n",

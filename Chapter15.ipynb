    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last chapter, you created an ndarray called ax. It was an array of SubplotAxes objects. You accessed one SubplotAxes by using an index in square brackets: ax[0]. You probably recognize that this is the same syntax used to access an element of a list. However, the ndarray is different than a list; it is an array. All the elements of an array are of the same type, and as a result the computer can access the elements more quickly. Lists and tuples are slower than arrays, but they can mix different data types, like strings and integers.\n",

The third array is a list of the three color intensities (RGB) of each pixel. Sometimes this third array has a fourth number for each pixel called the alpha channel that identifies how opaque the pixel is. Opaque is the opposite of transparent; you cannot see through an opaque object.

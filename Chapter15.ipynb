    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last chapter, you created an ndarray called ax. It was an array of SubplotAxes objects. You accessed one SubplotAxes by using an index in square brackets: ax[0]. You probably recognize that this is the same syntax used to access an element of a list. However, the ndarray is different than a list; it is an array. All the elements of an array are of the same type, and as a result the computer can access the elements more quickly. Lists and tuples are slower than arrays, but they can mix different data types, like strings and integers.\n",

RGB color images are 3 dimensional arrays. The first array is how many rows of pixels there are in the image. The second array is how many pixels there are in a row. The third array is a list of the three color intensities (RGB) of each pixel from 0-255. Sometimes this third array has a fourth number for each pixel called the alpha channel that identifies how opaque the pixel is. Opaque is the opposite of transparent; you cannot see through an opaque object.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ways to send secret information in photographs using the lowest-place-value bits in each color byte. Concealing information in an image is called <b><u>steganography</u></b>, which is what this section should be entitled. (I just called it \"The Illuminati\" to try to get you to read it!) The 1s place and 2s place of each RGB pixel intensity could be changed to encode the numbers 0 to 63, more than enough for the alphabet. Let's see if you can understand how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say a single pixel in your image is colored white. The RGB array for this is [255, 255, 255]. The number 255 is a decimal number. We can convert it to a binary number which would use 8 bits or 1 byte of data. The array would now look like [11111111, 11111111, 11111111]. The ones and the twos place are what we call the <b>least significant bits</b>. We can change these least sigbits and not even come close to changing the color to the human eye.<br><br>\n",
    "<center> \n",
    "11111100 =  252<br>\n",
    "11111101 =  253<br>\n",

    "11111111 =  255<br><br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have 2 <b>least significant bits</b> in each byte and 3 bytes/pixel we could use 6 bits/pixel to store information and no human would be able to notice a difference in the image. A string of 6 bits would allow us to encode 0 to 63. Since there are only 26 letters of the alphabet technically we would only need 5 bits to encode secret messages in pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at an example: Suppose we have a magneta pixel:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>RGB = (255, 0, 255) = (11111111, 00000000, 11111111) binary</center><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply changed the last two bits of each byte to the following:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>(111111<b>01</b>, 000000<b>10</b>, 111111<b>01</b>)</center><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "we could stay very near the same color value of magenta but encode for the letter <b>(y)</b>. HOW, you ask? Well, first we set A-Z to equal 1-26. Next, we always take the last two bits of the binary pixel colors and string them together. So for our modified magenta pixel above that would be:<br><br>\n",
    "<center>011001</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This binary number 011001 converts to decimal 25 which would correlate to the 25th letter of the alphabet <b>(y)</b>! Even with a small 100 x 100 pixel image, you could send a 10,000 character hidden message. Crazy awesome, right? Below I have created a steganography program that will let you encode messages into an image file or decode messages from images that have already been encoded. Also below is an image which I have already encoded with a secret message. Use the program to determine the message. Once you have decoded it, feel free to encode with a new message and e-mail to a friend. They of course will not be able to determine the message unless they have this same decoding program.

      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you've probably learned by now when something goes wrong with your program, ugly error messages are thrown up in the Session window. We would rather our user not see this happen. To solve this problem we need exceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions are used to handle abnormal conditions that can occur during the execution of code. Exceptions are often used with file and network operations. This allows code to gracefully handle running out of disk space, network errors, or permission errors."

      "<ul>\n",
      "<li><i><b>Exception</b></i>: This term could mean one of two things. First, the condition that results in abnormal program flow. Or it could be used to refer to an object that represents the data condition. Each exception has an object that holds information about it.\n",
      "<li><i><b>Exception handling</b></i>: The process of handling an exception to normal program flow.\n",
      "<li><i><b>Catch block or exception block</b></i>: Code that handles an abnormal condition is said to \u201ccatch\u201d the exception.\n",
      "<li><i><b>Throw or raise</b></i>: When an abnormal condition to the program flow has been detected, an instance of an exception object is created. It is then \u201cthrown\u201d or \u201craised\u201d to code that will catch it.\n",
      "<li><i><b>Unhandled exception or Uncaught exception</b></i>: An exception that is thrown, but never caught. This usually results in an error and the program ending or crashing.\n",
      "<li><i><b>Try block</b></i>: A set of code that might have an exception thrown in it.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most programming languages use the terms \u201cthrow\u201d and \u201ccatch.\u201d Unfortunately Python doesn't. Python uses \u201craise\u201d and \u201cexception.\u201d We introduce the throw/catch vocabulary here because they are the most prevalent terms in the industry."
